# Password Generator Starter Code

Very modular. Tried to follow ETC principle (easy to change). Functions do one thing and do it well.

Could have generated the password in different ways. I chose to combine lists of types of characters into a master list to randomly sample from iteratively.

## Future:
* Could receive user inputs through a form
* Could add a copy button
